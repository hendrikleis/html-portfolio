<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>
  I am a very athletic person and I love going outdoors, hiking, walking and
  playing. I love doing sports, amongst my favourites is volleyball, which I am
  quite passionate about. I also love going to the gym and lifting weights.
  Something I have been drawn to for most of my life, is music, for nearly 10
  years I sang in a boys choir and achieved great results in international
  competitions, currently I am ssinging in a mens choir. In addition, I have
  played the fluet and for many years now I have played the clarinet, piano is
  also an instrument I love playing. In my spare time I read books, adventure
  stories are the most exciting ones, but science books are also fascinating. I
  love watching movies, especially thrillers and action movies.
